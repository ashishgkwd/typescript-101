# Interfaces

TypeScriptâ€™s core principle is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have.\

This means that TypeScript interface relies on the structural definition for type safety.\

Basically, two interfaces having the same structure/member definition are considered equal or interchangable by TypeScript.\

This allows developer to define predicatable contracts for their API's

Along with the above TypeScript interfaces also offer following extra features:

* Optional members
* Read Only members 
* Extending from classes
* Function Types
